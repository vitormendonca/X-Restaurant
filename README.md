# X-Restaurant
First ever website
-The objective was training what I learned and make a showcase of my actual skills on Javascript, CSS and HTML. 
Honestly,I felt so good doing it, because I feel confident working with Javascript DOM at the moment.
Highlights :
The Menu (menu.html), Form validation(reservation.html) and on the overlay background on the home slide. Where I could use a bit of the DOM.
I could use many CSS properties as GRID in the form (reservation.html) and in the menu (menu.html). I used Flex-box as well.
I did not made it responsive, the reason was that my main goal was to test my javascript code.


It's not responsive, but it was my first studying project.
